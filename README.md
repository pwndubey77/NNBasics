##Convolution -> or running convolutions is finding correlation between feature extractor/kernel and in given/defined space/object/image, to find existence of some building blocks like vertical edge , horizontal edge etc.
     

##filter/kernel :
    a matrix to extract or check some patterns in other matrix through convolutions , like edge detection…. ?

##epochs
	Time taken to go through a dataset(completely) once

##1x1 convolution
      Reducing z-dimensionality or depth in output or channels to n # of filters used with 1*1 convolution

##3x3 convolution


##Feature maps
   features extracted after convolution of various kernels..

##Activation function
   a check or constraint to include the feature or not in feature map , ??? 

##Receptive field
  thw size/portion of image or the portion of object which can be analyzed by kernel , usually size of kernel…local will be of kernel size and global rf will be equal or larger than object.

## 1- Convolution 
 or running convolutions is finding correlation between feature extractor/kernel and in given/defined space/object/image, to find existence of some building blocks like vertical edge , horizontal edge etc.  

## 2- Filter/Kernel :
   a matrix to extract or check some patterns in other matrix through convolutions , like edge detectionâ€¦. 

## 3- Epochs
   Time taken to go through a dataset(completely) once

## 4- 1x1 convolution
   can create something new with recombing existing info and reduce no of channels required (Z-channel reduction)

## 5- 3x3 convolution
   kernel with 3x3 to convole images , and one of the most used.

## 6- Feature maps
   Output or Features extracted after convolution of various kernels..

## 7- Activation function
   a check or constraint to include the parameter in output or not. 

## 8- Receptive field
   part of kernel or output layer which have information of image/object's part by convolving on part/pixels of previous layers.
